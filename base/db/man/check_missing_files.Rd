\usage{
check_missing_files(result, existing.input = NULL, existing.dbfile = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{result}{A list of data frames containing file information. Each data frame is expected to have a column named `file` with absolute file paths created by a data-conversion or download function. For example, this might be the structure returned by a "download_X" or "met2model_X" function when invoked via [convert_input()].}

\item{existing.input}{A data frame or list of data frames (possibly zero rows) representing input records in the BETY `inputs` table that match (or partially match) the data being added. This is converted to a list of data frames if it is not already.}

\item{existing.dbfile}{A data frame or list of data frames (possibly zero rows) representing dbfile records in the BETY `dbfiles` table that match (or partially match) the data being added. This is also converted to a list of data frames if it is not already.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item A list of data frames for `existing.input`
  \item A list of data frames for `existing.dbfile`
}
}
\description{
This function inspects the file paths in a list of data frames (typically produced by a download or conversion routine) to ensure that each file is present and non-empty. Specifically, it checks whether any file path is missing or has a file size of zero, and logs an error if such files are detected. It also normalizes `existing.input` and `existing.dbfile` so that each is returned as a list of data frames.
}
\details{
The function calculates the file size for each file specified in the `result` data frames. If any file path is missing (`NA`) or any file size is zero, the function raises a fatal error (via [PEcAn.logger::logger.severe]) indicating that an expected file is either nonexistent or empty. If no such issues are found, it merely ensures that `existing.input` and `existing.dbfile` are each wrapped in a list for consistent downstream usage.
